# Sunflower

This project was created with the intent of practicing my skills in React, CSS and git repositories. 
Feel free to learn with me and to pull any code you might want from it.

As long as everyone becomes a better person for it, I don't mind sharing.

Like I said, this is a React app, so remember to have react and all its dependancies installed and to have the right tool to edit it.
